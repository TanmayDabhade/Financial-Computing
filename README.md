## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based toolkit designed for performing comprehensive financial analysis and advanced financial computations. It provides a set of modules and functions that streamline tasks such as fetching market data, calculating key financial metrics, performing portfolio optimization, running risk assessments, and generating actionable investment insights.

## Features

- **Market Data Retrieval**  
  Easily fetch price data, historical quotes, and fundamental metrics for stocks, bonds, ETFs, and other financial instruments.

- **Financial Metrics & Indicators**  
  Compute returns, volatility, Sharpe ratios, moving averages, MACD, and various other technical and fundamental indicators.

- **Portfolio Analysis & Optimization**  
  Perform mean-variance optimization, construct efficient frontiers, and conduct scenario analyses to improve portfolio allocation.

- **Risk Management**  
  Estimate Value-at-Risk (VaR), Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), and beta values for assets or portfolios. Stress-test portfolios against various market conditions.

- **Automated Reports & Visualizations**  
  Generate PDF reports, interactive charts, and dashboards to help visualize trends, correlations, and performance over time.
